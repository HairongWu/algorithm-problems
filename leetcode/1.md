# Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

Solution:
Unordered map is an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Search, insertion, and removal of elements have average constant-time complexity.

Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its key. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once the hash is computed, it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.
```cpp
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (m.count(target - nums[i])) {
                return {i, m[target - nums[i]]};
            }
            m[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
```

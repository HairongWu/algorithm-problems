# Reorder Data in Log Files
 
 You have an array of `logs`.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

- Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
- Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

Example 1:
```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
```
Constraints:

1. `0 <= logs.length <= 100`
2. `3 <= logs[i].length <= 100`
3. `logs[i]` is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

Solution:

```
    vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<string> res, digitLogs;
        vector<vector<string>> data;
        for (string log : logs) {
            auto pos = log.find(" ");
            if (log[pos + 1] >= '0' && log[pos + 1] <= '9') {
                digitLogs.push_back(log);
                continue;
            }
            data.push_back({log.substr(0, pos), log.substr(pos + 1)});
        }
        sort(data.begin(), data.end(), [](vector<string>& a, vector<string>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1] || (a[1] == b[1] && a[0] < b[0]);
        });
        for (auto &a : data) {
            res.push_back(a[0] + " " + a[1]);
        }
        for (string log : digitLogs) res.push_back(log);
        return res;
    }
```

# Two City Scheduling
A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array costs where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the ith person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```
Example 3:
```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086
```
Constraints:

- `2n == costs.length`
- `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
- `costs.length` is even.
- `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

Solution:
```cpp
    static int diff(vector<int>& x) {
        return x[1] - x[0];
    }
    static bool cmpfunc(vector<int>& lhs, vector<int>& rhs) {
        return diff(lhs) > diff(rhs);
    }
    // Just simply sort the array by comparing the different cost go to A city and B city
    // then the bigger difference would be in left and right side, and the smaller difference would be in the middle
    // We could simply let the first half go to A city, and the second half go to B city.
    int twoCitySchedCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        sort(costs.begin(), costs.end(), cmpfunc);
        int result = 0;
        int len = costs.size();
        for (int i=0; i<len/2; i++) {
            result += (costs[i][0] + costs[len-i-1][1]);
        }
        return result;
    }
```

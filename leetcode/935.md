# Knight Dialer

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

![knight](./pictures/knight.png "knight") ![keypad](./pictures/keypad.png "keypad")

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes `N-1` hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing `N` digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: 10
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 2
Output: 20
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 3
Output: 46
```
Note:

1. 1 <= N <= 5000

Solution:
```
    int knightDialer(int N) {
        int res = 0, M = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(N, vector<int>(10));
        vector<vector<int>> path{{4, 6}, {6, 8}, {7, 9}, {4, 8}, {3, 9, 0}, {}, {1, 7, 0}, {2, 6}, {1, 9}, {4, 2}};
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) dp[0][i] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= 9; ++j) {
                for (int idx : path[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][idx]) % M;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) res = (res + dp.back()[i]) % M;
        return res;
    }
```
